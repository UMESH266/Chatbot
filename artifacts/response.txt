The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. Here are the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci series:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34

You can generate the Fibonacci series using a simple loop in most programming languages. Here's an example in Python:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    while len(fib_sequence) < n:
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
    return fib_sequence

print(fibonacci(10))
```

This code will output the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci series. You can adjust the value of `n` to get a different number of terms in the series.
